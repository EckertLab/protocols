##Appendix B: Recovery and Cleaning of Beads and S-Blocks

###Cleaning beads and grinding balls

Tungsten carbide and stainless steel beads and grinding balls can be reused. Used beads can be recovered from cell-debris and cleaned using the procedure below.

1. Seal the collection microtubes with caps. Place a clear cover (saved from step 1 of DNeasy 96 Plant procedures) over each rack of collection microtubes and knock the racks upside down against the bench 5 times to free the tungsten carbide beads from the surrounding material.
1. Empty the contents of the tubes/jars into a sieve and rinse the beads thoroughly with water.
1. Incubate beads in 0.4 M HCl* for 1 min at room temperature (15–25°C) to degrade any DNA and avoid cross-contamination in future preparations.
1. Rinse beads thoroughly with distilled water to remove the HCl.
1. Dry beads before use.

*When working with chemicals, always wear a suitable lab coat, disposable gloves, and protective goggles. For more information, consult the appropriate safety data sheets (SDSs), available from the product supplier.
