#Gel Extraction Protocol

####*Prep 1*:
  * Label a blue-capped 15mL centrifuge tube as **Pooled PCR product of [sample X] [date] [initials]**.  
Combine all of the wells from the two PCR product plates into the 15mL tube. It is best to let this sit and settle overnight so that the bubbles go down
   * Alternatively, pipette the bubbles into a 1mL microcentrifuge tube and spin on microcentrifuge. Add the contents of microcentrifuge tube back to pooled PCR product.

####*Prep 2*:
  * Make a 1% agarose gel by following the [Casting Gel](https://github.com/EckertLab/protocols/blob/master/casting_gels.md) protocol for a 4" x 5.75" gel.

####*Main Protocol adapted from [DNeasyÂ® Plant Handbook](http://www.qiagen.com/resources/resourcedetail?id=95dec8a9-ec37-4457-8884-5dedd8ba9448&lang=en)*:
1.	Place 1% agarose gel in electrophoresis apparatus and make sure that it is completely submerged in 1x TAE buffer.
1.	On a piece of wax paper place two 3uL drops of loading dye.
  1. After dye has been placed, add 3uL of DNA ladder to each of the two drops of dye
  2. Add the first dye/ladder drop to the first lane of the gel
  3. Add the second dye/ladder drop to the 14th lane of the gel
1.	Into a 1.5mL centrifuge tube combine 710uL of pooled PCR product and 36uL of loading dye
  1.	Add 60uL of the dye/PCR-product mix to each of lanes 2-13
1.	Run gel for 1 hour at 110V
1.	After running gel, label 12 microcentrifuge tubes 1-12
1.	Using a scalpel or razor blade, cut out the section of the gel between 300-500bp while over UV light
  1.	Make sure to minimize exposure of DNA to UV light
1.	Cut out each of the 12 lanes from the excised gel section and trim off excess gel from each, minimizing exposure of DNA to UV light
  1.	Place each lane into one of the 12 labeled microcentrifuge tubes; order does not matter
  1.	Zero the scale with an empty 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube
  1.	Place each of the 12 microcentrifuge tubes containing excised lanes on the scale and record mass in lab notebook with respective label of tube
1.	Add 3 volumes of QG buffer to each tube and incubate at 50*C in waterbath until completely dissolved. Set to 5.
  1.	For example, for a 100mg (0.1g) sample, add 300uL of QG buffer
  1.	Note that the QG buffer is slow to come out of the pipette tip, make sure that the total volume is delivered to each tube
