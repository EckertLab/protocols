#Gel Extraction Protocol

####*Prep 1*:
  * Label a blue-capped 15mL centrifuge tube as **Pooled PCR product of [sample X] [date] [initials]**.  
Combine all of the wells from the two PCR product plates into the 15mL tube. It is best to let this sit and settle overnight so that the bubbles go down
   * Alternatively, pipette the bubbles into a 1mL microcentrifuge tube and spin on microcentrifuge. Add the contents of microcentrifuge tube back to pooled PCR product.

####*Prep 2*:
  * Make a 1% agarose gel by following the [Casting Gel](https://github.com/EckertLab/protocols/blob/master/casting_gels.md) protocol for a 4" x 5.75" gel.

####*Main Protocol*:
1.	Place 1% agarose gel in electrophoresis apparatus and make sure that it is completely submerged in 1x TAE buffer.
1.	On a piece of wax paper place two 3uL drops of loading dye.
  1. After dye has been placed, add 3uL of DNA ladder to each of the two drops of dye
  2. Add the first dye/ladder drop to the first lane of the gel
  3. Add the second dye/ladder drop to the 14th lane of the gel
