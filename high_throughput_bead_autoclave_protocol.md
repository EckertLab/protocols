# High Throughput Bead Autoclave Protocol

1. Combine beads into a dry 100mL beaker 
  1. Cover mouth of beaker with tinfoil 
  1. Secure foil with autoclave tape
1. Check to make sure that there is steam available, this is the left “Jacket” gage (the right gage shows internal pressure) – If not contact Dr. Eckert
1. Place beaker into autoclave-safe tray
1. Place tray into autoclave near the front of rack to avoid having to reach for it later
1. Close door and turn handle clockwise until handle is tight enough so that sufficient effort does not move handle counterclockwise
  1. Make sure moving hinges around circumference of door are inside main apparatus. If not, the door is not sealed properly: loosen door and close correctly.
1. Set to “Gravity and Dry” by pressing down appropriate white button
1. Set autoclave timer – this is the top timer – to 25 minutes
  1. Press “set” and use arrows below each digit to adjust value
  1. Press “ent” (enter) so that the autoclave accepts adjusted time
1. Set dry timer – this is the bottom timer – to 15 minutes
  1. Use same procedure as 6a-6b
1. Press “Start”
1. Remain near autoclave until internal pressure reaches 20 lbs  in-2 (“Chamber” gage on right) and internal temperature reaches 250° 
  1. Should steam begin to escape apparatus, press “stop” button
  1. If the risk of burn from outpouring steam is too great to reach the “stop” button, check the backside of the apparatus – there should be another “stop” button there as well. If this button is unable to be reached, seek assistance immediately.
1. To take out samples or to reset autoclave after steam escape
  1. Put on protective gloves
  1. Hold arms at length from body to maximize distance from apparatus
  1. Slowly turn handle counterclockwise
  1. When hinges are free, very slowly begin opening door. Stop opening as soon as steam begins to escape – this allows steam to go up into the overhead vents
  1. Once steam outflow has lessened, remain at arm’s-length and open the door a little more to allow the rest of steam to escape
  1. Slowly open door to avoid harm from remaining steam
  1. Remove samples
  1. Close door, no need to lock hinges into apparatus
