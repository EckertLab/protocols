#Water Autoclave Protocol

1. Fill cap-sealable bottle(s) with DI water
  1. Do not screw on lid, screw just enough so that when pulling up on it the lid will hold onto the bottle; once the water is heated inside the bottle, air and vapor will need to escape
1. Place bottle(s) into an autoclave-safe tub
  1. Fill tub with a 1-2 inches of water
1. Place tub into the autoclave near the front of the rack to avoid having to reach for it later
1. Close door and turn handle clockwise until handle is tight enough so that sufficient effort does not move handle counterclockwise
  1. Make sure moving hinges around circumference of door are inside main apparatus. If not, the door is not sealed properly: loosen door and close correctly.
1. Set to “Liquids Exhaust” setting by pressing down the appropriate white button
1. Set autoclave timer – this is the top timer – to 25:00
  1. Press “set” and use arrows below each digit to adjust value
  1. Press “ent” (enter) so that the autoclave accepts the adjusted time
1. Set the dry timer – this is the bottom timer – to 0:00 using same procedure as 6i – 6ii.
  1. Having a drying time >0:00 will cause the autoclave to release pressure too rapidly at the end of the cycle and bottles may explode.
1. Press Start
1. Remain near autoclave until internal pressure reaches 20 lbs per in<sup>2</sup> (“Chamber” gage on right) and internal temperature reaches 250° 
  1. Should steam begin to escape apparatus, press “stop” button
  1. If the risk of burn from outpouring steam is too great to reach the “stop” button, check the backside of the apparatus – there should be another “stop” button there as well. If this button is unable to be reached, seek assistance immediately.
  1. Make sure to use the autoclave log sheet
1. To take out samples or to reset autoclave after steam escape
  1. Put on protective gloves
  1. Hold arms at length from body to maximize distance from apparatus
  1. Slowly turn handle counterclockwise
  1. When hinges are free, very slowly begin opening door. Stop opening as soon as steam begins to escape – this allows steam to go up into the overhead vents
  1. Once steam outflow has lessened, remain at arm’s-length and open the door a little more to allow the rest of steam to escape
  1. Slowly open door to avoid harm from remaining steam
  1. Remove samples
  1. Close door, no need to lock hinges into apparatus
