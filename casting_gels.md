#Casting gels for electrophoresis and gel extractions

####Prep: Make stock solution of 1.00x TAE buffer for use in gel casting and buffer solution in gel boxes during electrophoresis.
  * Using a graduated cylinder, measure out 100mL of 10x TAE buffer.
  * Using a graduated cylinder, measure out 900mL of DI H<sub>2</sub>O.
  * Combine the two volumes in a 1000mL orange-capped Pyrex jar.
  * Label jar with TAE concentration, your initials, and the date.

####Making 1% gel with 1.00x TAE buffer:
_Directions for 4" x 5.75" gel (used in gel extraction)_:
* Set up gel mold with comb in place. Use bubble-level to ensure even settling of gel matrix.
* Add 2.25g agarose to a 500mL Erlenmeyer flask  
  * Add 225mL of 1.00x TAE buffer to the flask  
* Microwave flask for 2.5 minutes 
  * After 2.5 minutes make sure agarose is completely dissolved in TAE. Swirl flask if it is not, microwave for another 15-20s if needed.  
* Add 1.5Î¼L ethidium bromide to flask.  
* Pour into gel mold with comb in place.  
* Let sit for ~30 minutes to 1 hour.  
*  While allowing gel to set, fill the 500mL Erlenmeyer flask with ~300mL of water  
  * microwave for 2.5 minutes.  
  * swirl and empty into drain.
