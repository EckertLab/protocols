# BURT DNA extraction

This is the modified version of the Qiagen Plant 96 Kit for extracting DNA from pine needles for the BURT project.

## Getting started

- [ ] Prepare your lab notebook, date, sample plate #, etc.
- [ ] Heat the water bath to to 65&#8451;. I set the temp to 10 and the limit to 6.5.
- [ ] Make not of the kit lot # and lot #s of all reagents, if you've not used the kit before.  If you have used the kit, reference it in your lab notebook.
- [ ] Prepare the centrifuge with the plate rotor and appropriate settings.
- [ ] Make sure you have clean flasks and graduated cylinder to accommodate multichannel reservoir volumes.

### Prepare the working lysis solution

The volumes below are for **two 96-well plates**.  If you are only doing a single plate, divide the volumes in half.

- [ ] Once the water bath has reached temperature, put solution **AP1** into the bath. If it starts to float, you can weigh it down with an inverted beaker on the top.  Let it warm for about **30 minutes**
- [ ] In a 100 ml disposable reservoir, add the following:
    - [ ] 90 ml pre-heated Buffer AP1
    - [ ] 225 &mu;l RNase A
    - [ ] 225 &mu;l Reagent DX

### Transfer needles to Qiagen shaker plate (light blue)

- [ ] Obtain a shaker plate and orient **identically** with the sample plate from the freezer (A1 in the upper left).
- [ ] For each sample of prepared (i.e., finely cut) needle tissue, invert the tube (cap on the bottom) and tap so that all needle tissue falls away from the tip of the tube.
- [ ] With sharp scissors, cut off (at a slight angle) the tip of the tube.
- [ ] In the identical well on the shaker plate, invert the needle tub again and tap the cap to transfer all of the tissue.
- [ ] Repeat for each sample until all 96 have been transferred from the plate in the freezer to the light blue shaker plate.
- [ ] Add a [clean](cleaning_beads.md) tungsten carbide bead to each tube.

## Prepare needles for lysis and grind

The volumes below are for **a single 96-well plate**.

- [ ] Add 400 &mu;l of working lysis solution to each collection microtube in the shaker plate.  Use a **multichannel pipettor** , a 50 ml disposable reservoir, and fill the tubes column-wise. 400 &mu;l x 96 wells x 1.1 = **42.2 ml**.
- [ ] Seal the tubes **very well** with the provided plastic cap strips.
- [ ] Assemble each rack into the TissueLyser adapter, making note of the orientation.  For the first round, keep the well A1 close to the tissue lyser.  Grind the samples at **20 Hz for 3 minutes**.
- [ ] For the second round, remove the metal adapter plates (maintaining their orientation), spin the shaker plate **180 degrees**, then place back into the adapter plates.  If you've done this right, well A1 is now closer to you than the machine.
- [ ] Grind the samples again at **20 Hz for 3 minutes**.

## Isolate the DNA

The volumes below are for **a single 96-well plate**.

- [ ] Following lysis, place the plates into the centrifuge and spin up to 3000 RPM to collect any buffer from the caps.
- [ ] Add 130 &mu;l of Buffer P3 to each tube using a **50 ml reservoir** and a multichannel pipettor (130 &mu;l x 96 wells x 1.1 = = **13.7 ml**).  Do this one column at a time, removing the cap strip and replacing with a new cap strip each time.
- [ ] Put the plastic lid back on the plate and shake (yes, shake) **vigorously** up and down for **15 seconds**.
- [ ] Spin plates up to 3000 RPM to collect from the caps.
- [ ] Incubate the plates in the -20&#8451; freezer for 10 minutes.
- [ ] Spin the plates for **5 minutes** at **3800 x g** (**not RPM!**).
- [ ] Transfer 400 &mu;l of the supernatant (careful to not pull in the pellet, though sometimes it's unavoidable to suck up a tiny bit - this has **direct consequences** on the quality and quantity of the downstream DNA!) to a new plate of collection microtubes.
    - [ ] This is done on an individual-tube basis.
    - [ ] **Make sure the new tubes are in the same orientation**
    - [ ] Use small scissors to cut the strip of tubes, containing the supernatant, apart, being careful to not disturb the pellet.
    - [ ] Into a new (and corresponding-by-position) microtube, transfer 400 &mu;l (2 x 200 &mu;l) of the supernatant.

## Bind the DNA

The volumes below are for **a single 96-well plate**.

- [ ] Using a 100 ml reservoir and a multichannel pipettor, add 600 &mu;l of Buffer AW1 to each sample.  600 &mu;l x 96 * 1.1 = **63.4 ml**
- [ ] Seal the tubes with new caps.
- [ ] Place the plastic lid back on the plate and shake **vigorously** for 15 seconds.
- [ ] Spin the plates up to 3000 RPM to collect from caps.
- [ ] Place a DNeasy 96 plate (the ones with the silica filters) on top of an S-Block.  Mark the DNeasy plate with the plate ID and **confirm the orientation**.
- [ ] Transfer 1 ml of each sample (5 x 200 &mu;l) using a multichannel pipettor.
- [ ] Seal the DNeasy plate with an AirPore tape sheet.
- [ ] Spin the plates at **3800 x g** for **4 minutes**.  After 4 minutes, visually inspect the plates.  If some liquid remains in some of the tubes, spin plates again at the same speed for 4 more minutes.

## Clean the DNA

The volumes below are for **a single 96-well plate**.

- [ ] Remove the AirPore tape sheet.
- [ ] Add 800 &mu;l of Buffer AW2 to each sample using a multichannel pipettor and a 100 ml reservoir.  800 &mu;l x 96 wells x  1.1 = **84.5 ml**.
- [ ] Spin for **15 minutes** at **3800 x g** without tape to dry the membrane.

## Elute the DNA

The volumes below are for **a single 96-well plate**.

- [ ] Obtain and label a new elution rack (dark blue).
- [ ] Place the DNeasy plate on top of the eluation rack (**maintaining orientation!**).
- [ ] Add 50 &mu;l of Buffer AE to each sample using a 25 ml disposable reservoir and a multichannel pipettor.  50 &mu;l x 96  * 1.1 = **5.3 ml**.  If the volume is too small to be picked up by the pipette, add a small volume (avoiding waste) until it works consistently for all channels.
- [ ] Seal the plate with a new AirPore tape sheet.
- [ ] Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
- [ ] Spin at **3800 x g** for **2 minutes**.
- [ ] Remove the tape sheet and **repeat steps 3 through 6**.
- [ ] Remove the DNeasy plate and seal the elution tubes with new caps to store the DNA.

## Quantitate

Using the newly extracted DNA, perform quantitation using the NanoDrop 8000 in the Dyer laboratory.  You can use the little multichannel, but I've had better luck just doing pulling them  individually for an entire column on the plate.

- [ ] Blank with Buffer AE from the kit you used, if possible.  Otherwise, find another container of AE.
- [ ] Use 2 &ul; draws from each sample for the NanoDrop, changing tips each time to **avoid contamination**.
- [ ] Make sure that the correct column is indicated in the software before you take measurements.
- [ ] Take 3 readings from the NanoDrop for each sample.  Do not add more DNA, just hit the measure button.  I take the average reading for a single 2 &ul; volume to represent the concentration.
- [ ] Once done, save the report on a thumb drive and give to Chris.
- [ ] We want 260/280 to be at least 1.8 and the concentration to be at least 10 ng/ml
