#Gel Extraction Protocol

####*Prep*:
Combine all of the wells from the two PCR product plates into one 15mL blue-capped centrifuge tube. It is best to let this sit and settle overnight so that the bubbles go down
  * Alternatively, pipette the bubbles into a 1mL microcentrifuge tube and spin on microcentrifuge. Add the contents of microcentrifuge tube back to pooled PCR product.
