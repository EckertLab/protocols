Protocols
=========

This repository holds protocols for the lab of
Andrew J. Eckert (EckertLab) at Virginia Commonwealth
University.  To get started, please do the following:

1. Create a local directory on your computer (e.g., ~/src/eckertlab)
2. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:EckertLab/protocols.git`
3. Change to the `protocols` directory and get started by adding, commiting and pushing back to this repository.

*or...*

* Click the `+` next to the repository name above and start editing online

Everyone in the Eckert Lab is an admin for this organization, but if you have trouble
please let us know.

##File types

All protocols should be written in Markdown, and will be nicely rendered by GitHub. If
you want to commit other types of files, please check with someone else to make sure it's
cool.

For more information on GitHub Flavored Markdown, which should be used to compose your
documents, please see https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown.

##Naming convention

Please name your files so that they are meaningful, names like `dna_concentration.md` is
better than, say, `brandons_drunken_afternoon_attempt_at_seeing_a_dna_pellet.md`.

##Printing

If you want to print the protocols, use the awesome [GitPrint](https://gitprint.com) extension or bookmarklet.

=====
Even if you're not in the lab, pull requests are welcome and encouraged.
