1.	Set the SpeedVac to 450C or medium drying rate in the equipment room on the 3rd floor or in Thombe’s lab, also on 3rd floor.  
FYI: The equipment room stays open after hours just in-case. Drying is typically not required but it will speed up the process if you are concentrating larger volumes. Don’t use the drying setting if you intend to pellet the samples.

2.	Bonnie or Jennifer are the contact person for the SpeedVac in equipment room and Sarah Rothschild for the one in Thombe’s lab.

3.	Allow 10-15 min for the SpeedVac to reach the set temperature. 


4.	Place your samples in centrifuge tubes with the cap facing the center of the SpeedVac. Make sure the tubes are OPEN.

5.	Push start (in Thombe’s lab) or flip the switch to concentrate (in the equipment room).


6.	Typically it takes half hour to reduce the volume to ½ of the original quantity.

7.	Vortex your tubes, just in-case a pellet was formed and centrifuge them to collect the liquid at the bottom.
